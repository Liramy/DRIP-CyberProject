# FullView
FullView is a cyber project made by myself in order to learn machine learning and use it to detect propaganda. <br />
This app is made to search a subject (for example: minimum wage) and get articles from the internet. <br />
Said articles are ranked by least amount of propaganda and most and given to the user. <br />
The client gives the subject to the server and the server returns it, whilst also saving the results. <br />
By saving the result a database of answers is created to make responding time lower. <br />
